# Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)

This folder contains my learning journey and practice code for **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)** concepts.

I am learning OOPS fundamentals and implementing each concept using **Java** with simple and clear examples.

## 📌 Concepts Covered
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

Each concept is stored in a **separate folder**, containing:
- Java source code file(s)
- A dedicated `README.md` explaining the concept

## 🎯 Purpose
- To understand OOPS concepts deeply
- To practice clean and structured Java code
- To build a strong foundation for interviews and real-world applications

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- Language: **Java**
- Paradigm: **Object-Oriented Programming**

> This repository will be updated regularly as I continue learning and improving my understanding of OOPS.
